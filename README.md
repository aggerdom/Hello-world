# Hello-world

~~Hello world. I like you, but I'm not sure I'm ready for the commit-ment~~

Hey everyone,

I'm Alex. Python is my main language, but I've done a few projects that I'm proud of in MATLAB and AutoHotKey as well. I would really like to learn more about logic programming and ontology languages such as OWL as formal logic is an interest of mine. Oh yah, and I would love to learn more about mini-languages such as graphviz. MORE SOON!
